# NumCapApp
Displays the state of the Caps Lock and Num Lock in Windows Notification using Windows Form App.

I bought an Asus. The Caps Lock key and the Num Lock don't indicate their state. In other words, there is no keyboard lights to indicate if the Caps Lock or Num Lock keys are active or inactive.

So I wrote this simple C# programming Visual Studio IDE (the IDE does most of the writing).

I also have a shortcut to the execuatble here, %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\NumCapApp.exe

You will need to fiddle with the four indicator icons in the Notification area so you can always see the two visible states. They may reside in Hidden Icons until you move them to the toolbar.

The four indicator icons are CapsLock on, CapsLock off, NumLock on, NumLock off - but obviously only two will be visible.

I've tried to keep this simple so anyone can follow and make modifications.
